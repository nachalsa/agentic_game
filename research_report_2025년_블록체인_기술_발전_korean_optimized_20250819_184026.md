 Based on the provided research and analysis in the report, the significant trends in blockchain technology for 2025 include digital transformation, increased adoption of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO), growth in development for Internet of Things (IoT) security, surge in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and the rise of Composable Scans and Funds (CSFs).

The positive impact of blockchain on various industries is evident through its applications in financial services such as trade verification, supply chain management, inventory tracking, and prevention and control of infectious diseases. It also benefits from increasing participation and understanding by major brands and electronic finance companies, driving the digitalization of products and services.
